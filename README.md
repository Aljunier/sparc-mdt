# SPARC – Secure Patrol And Records Console

**SPARC (Secure Patrol And Records Console)** is a full-stack **mobile data terminal (MDT)** application built with both a frontend and backend. It's designed to simulate the tools used in real-world patrol and dispatch systems — including access to records, reports, and mission-critical data — all within an intuitive and responsive interface.

This project is my second take on an MDT, drawing inspiration from a version I originally built about four years ago. SPARC represents a complete reimagining of that idea with improved architecture, cleaner design, and modern development practices.
